HWdapp is a hello world decentralized application. Contains the basic functionality so you can use it as a template and start building your own application.

Think of it as a hello world dapp starter kit.

## what the dapp does?

![Screenshot](./docs/HWdapp.png)

- show text stored in the blockchain, and update that text. interact directly with ethereum blockchain!! (a testnet).

- feel free to udpdate the text of my contract through ehterscan.io at RINKEBY -> 0x06188947C018B21b9D20417D31A7f00f414919e4

- after making the transaction to update the text, please wait around 20 seconds there, until the transaction is confirmed, the app will automatically detect the change and update the text.

## what you will need

1. npm
2. an alchemy.com account -> [https://www.alchemy.com](url)
3. metamask account -> [https://metamask.io](url)
4. fake ether from the testnet you want to use  -> [https://faucet.rinkeby.io](url)

## Installation

Clone this repository, 'cd' into the folder and let npm work
```bash
cd HWdapp
npm install
``` 
The package.json should be able to download all needed dependencies.
- note: in case hardhat was not automatically installed please go into "HWdapp/contracts" and run:
```bash
npm install
``` 

## Usage

- to compile, run from "HWdpp/contracts"

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

- to test on a local network (live only during execution), run from "HWdpp/contracts"
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/run.js
```

- to test on a local network (live undefined) with access to 20 accounts, with 1000eth, 0 blocks mined.
```bash
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

note: run the second command from a different terminal window but without closing the first terminal window with the first command running


- to test on a testnet (i.e. rinkeby)
1. go to HWdapp/contracts
2. open file called "secret.json"
3. add your alchemy.com api url and your metamask account private key
4. from HWapp/contracts try:
```bash
run npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```

- link your contract and react
1. open "HWapp/src/App.jsx"
2. replace "contractAddress" with your contract address
3. from HWdapp root folder try:
```bash
npm run dev
```
that will run vite and our app will be live!

## Disclaimer
I don't consider myself an expert, take this code as what it is (a path to the needed tools, folders, configurations to build, test and deploy locally a dapp)

Please note the goal of this repository is to give a clearer path of how to locally build dapps, I found myself having trouble to understand how to develop locally and now that I have a kinda better idea I wanted to share with anyone interested the tools that I used and make available this simple template.

- note1: these are not the only tools available to build and deploy dapps.
- note2: I used solidity 0.8.4 - (no specific reason)
- note3: regarding the alchemy.com account, it is free, from there we just need to create an app and copy the its key
- note4: I did not talk about some steps because I though you could handle them by yourself (funding your metamask with fake ether, create an alchemy account, etc)
- note5: any questions, comments, suggestions feel free to ping me at discord @msaucedo#2231


## FAQ

- what technologies do you use?
> - hardhat - compile, test and create a local blockchain
> - react js - build front end, animations, make your app look cute
> - vite - live server to deploy your dapp locally
> - ethers - bridge react and hardhat (interact with your contract from the front-end)

- I'm having issues compiling and running the project, what should I do?
> go to the terminal, write down the error and try googling it, if no luck ping me @msaucedo#2231 at discord.

- What is that run.js and deploy.js files for?
> After building your smart contract, you will need to test it. Even tho testing on a testnet is way more fun, sometimes we need to test locally.
> - run.js will deploy your contract in a local blockchain live only during code execution
> - deploy.js will depoy your contract in a local blockchain, live undefined (till your shut it down) this is done with hardhat, something cool with this method is that you will have 20 Etherium addreses, 1000eth, and a 0 mined blocks blockchain.
